## NOT affiliated with Stardew Valley or ConcernedApe!!!
Mobile application of an Informational Guide to the popular video game, Stardew Valley. This is a personal project meant to display my front-end design and development skills. I wanted to compile the most important game data that I look up most frequently in order to make game play quicker and more efficient.

## Getting Started

This project is a Flutter application. It can be run on an iOS or Android device or mobile device simulator. To start the application, run `main.dart` found in the lib folder.
